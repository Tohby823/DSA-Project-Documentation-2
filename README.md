# üìä Power BI Project Documentation

This project is part of a capstone case study in the **Power BI Data Analysis Program**, aimed at uncovering gender-related HR issues within a Nigerian manufacturing company‚Äî**Palmora Group**‚Äîthrough strategic HR data visualization and insight generation.

## Project Topic: Gender Equality in the Workplace | Strategic HR Analysis at Palmora Group

### üß≠ Project Overview

Palmora Group, a regional manufacturing firm based in Nigeria, was recently criticized in the media for potential gender bias in its employment practices. As an HR Data Analyst, I was tasked with investigating the organization's gender landscape using Power BI.

This analysis focuses on:
- Gender representation across departments and regions
- Gender pay gap analysis
- Salary structure compliance with a national $90,000 minimum wage regulation
- Performance rating trends by gender
- Performance-based bonus allocation and payouts

The final outcome includes a comprehensive dashboard visualizing trends, highlighting inequalities, and supporting management‚Äôs decisions with clear, actionable insights.

### üìÅ Data Sources

The primary datasets used for this analysis are:

- `Palmora Group emp-data.csv`: Contains employee information including gender, department, region, salary, and performance rating.
- `Palmora Group Bonus Rules.xlsx`: Contains business logic for assigning bonus payments based on employee performance.

These were provided as part of the HR Analytics case files.

### üßº Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key steps taken to prepare the dataset include:

- Replacing missing gender values with `"Undisclosed"`
- Removing employees with missing salaries (ex-employees)
- Dropping records with `"NULL"` departments
- Merging bonus rule data with employee dataset via performance rating
- Creating salary band groupings in increments of $10,000

### üîç Exploratory HR Analysis

Core business questions explored:

1. **Gender Distribution**
   - What is the overall gender distribution?
   - How does gender distribution vary by region and department?

2. **Performance Ratings**
   - Are there rating disparities between genders?
   - Which gender has the highest average performance rating?

3. **Salary Structure & Gender Pay Gap**
   - Are males and females equally paid in similar departments/regions?
   - Where are the pay gaps most significant?

4. **Minimum Wage Compliance**
   - How many employees earn less than the $90,000 minimum wage?
   - Which departments or regions are most affected?

5. **Salary Band Distribution**
   - How many employees fall into each $10,000 salary band?
   - Regional distribution of these bands

6. **Bonus Allocation**
   - How much bonus should each employee receive based on performance?
   - What is the total payout per region and across the company?

### üí∞ Bonus Rule Logic

| Performance Rating Range | Bonus % |
|--------------------------|---------|
| 4.5 ‚Äì 5.0                | 20%     |
| 4.0 ‚Äì 4.49               | 15%     |
| 3.5 ‚Äì 3.99               | 10%     |
| Below 3.5                | 5%      |

**Formula:**
- `Bonus = Salary √ó Bonus%`
- `Total Pay = Salary + Bonus`
